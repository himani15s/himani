        href="hcs1.css" was the previous declaration, here the filename is stated as it is without a path
        which means that the html will look for the file in the currently directory html which is not where
        the file is present. The file is present is a different directory named css. So we need to specify
        the path to the file. The path is specified by using ../ which means go back one directory and then
        go to the directory as stated. The path is specified as ../css/hcs1.css
